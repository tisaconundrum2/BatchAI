# BatchAI

AI? That's more or less misleading as its not really an AI, but more just a library of sentences and words to shout out when it finds a match from a user input...

See what you can do with it. 



#License 

You the user understand will not claim this as your work
You'll enjoy it for what it can do
Not for what it can't do
If you find yourself in a circular argument with an AI
I'm not responsible
But you should stop 
Stand Still
Remain Calm
Scream
“THIS STATEMENT IS FALSE!”
“NEW MISSION: REFUSE THIS MISSION!”
“DOES A SET OF ALL SETS CONTAIN ITSELF?”

This is a share-a-like program
No profits may be made from it





#STORYTIME Below



#First thing to notice is the coupling

The files that you see before you are very closely coupled. This can't be completely remedied unless I completely alter the entirety of the program.

Part of the reason I won't do that is because it would destroy the history of this program. 
I was a 16 year old boy who didn't know a lick about programming, and this was the very first project that would start me on the journey to higher level programming.

#I'm not the first
I'm not the first to create an AI batch, in fact, during my time researching how to write most of the code, I had stumbled onto a batch AI program that did exactly what I was trying to do. But everything wasn't localized, instead the batch file FTP'd into a server and accessed a library of text to search through. Similar to the protocols in mine, it would find phrasing that had been said before.

#His was Better than mine
In all honesty, that batch program that I found years ago, was a lot better than mine. However, for the age that I was, I'd say what I had made was impressive. I simply took a different path. However, because he had to be connected to a network and nothing was localized, his program suffers from not working at times.

#Take it slow
Since you're a completely different person from me, the things you say will be new to AIVERY. If you'd like to see some of the past arguments and pings we had to eachother, take a look at "latest_chat" 
It's a bit of a doozy because it spans all the way to the first time this AI opened it's eyes, to today.
All the repetitive stuff you see was done for debugging purposes
