# BatchAI
AI? That's more or less misleading as its not really an AI, but more just a library of sentences and words to shout out when it finds a match from a user input...
See what you can do with it.

## First thing to notice is the coupling

The files you see before you are closely coupled. This issue cannot be completely resolved unless I make significant changes to the entire program. One of the reasons I am hesitant to do so is that it would erase the history of this program. I was a 14-year-old boy with no knowledge of programming, and this project marked the beginning of my journey into higher-level programming.

## I'm not the first

I'm not the first to create an AI Command Prompt program. In fact, during my research on how to write most of the code, I stumbled upon a batch AI program that accomplished exactly what I was trying to do. However, there was a significant difference. Instead of localizing everything, the batch file would FTP into a server and access a library of text to search through. Similar to the protocols in my program, it would find phrases that had been said before.

## His was Better than mine

In all honesty, that batch program I found years ago was a lot better than mine. However, considering my age at the time, I'd like to think what I had created was impressive. I simply took a different path. The downside of his program was that it relied on being connected to a network, causing it to occasionally malfunction.

## Take it slow

Since you're a completely different person from me, the things you say will be new to AIVERY. If you'd like to see some of the past arguments and interactions we had, take a look at `latest_chat.txt`. It's a bit of a doozy because it spans all the way from the first time this AI opened its eyes. Please note that the repetitive content you encounter was included for debugging purposes.

## ENJOY
